						<h2 class="text">Actually responsive</h3>
						<p class="lede text">Is 'responsive design' just 'designing for all screen types'? I believe 'responsive' means much more. It means designing and building websites that respond to the user: who they are, what they need to achieve.</p>
						 <p class="text">I start every project by getting to know your users. Here, I drew up detailed User Case Studies, drawn from various sources: discussion with the client, who knew their customer better than anybody else; detailed analysis of existing (or competitor) analytics, and structured interviews with key stakeholders.</p>
						<p class="text">Once I've mapped who your users are, what they need, and what you need them to do, we can design something bespoke for them. That means a) sites that work for your intended audience, b) market-leading conversion rates, and c) unparallelled user experience.</p>
						<p class="text">Here, we separated the key user groups â€“ Exhibitors and Visitors â€“ from subsidiary user groups (such as Contractors). Each of the two main groups can filter out irrelevant information, which cuts scrolling (especially on mobile devices) and lowers the tendency for on-page information to compete for a user's limited attention. Information relevant to each user group is colour-coordinated: again, providing users with clear, instruction-rich routes to achieving their aims as quickly as possible.</p>

						<h2 class="text">Cutting-edge technology that gracefully degrades</h2>
						<p class="lede text">Wouldn't it be great if you could leave a project safe in the knowledge it'll work from here to the end of time? A lot of clients ask me about 'future-proofing'. No-one wants a site that looks and feels outdated within a year of being delivered. On the other hand, no-one wants a site that only programmers can view on their specced-up, Chrome-running supercomputers. I select technologies which meet all these needs.</p>
						<p class="text">Here, I've built a high-performance <a href="rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> that serves content from an ultra-secure <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database. This means the client can use their content â€“ bookings, news articles, exhibitor lists, and so much more â€“ in a whole range of ways, all from a single place. The website is built using the <a href="emberjs.org">EmberJS</a> JavaScript framework, which means a) no page loads (critical for rural connections), b) high cross-browser consistency, and c) excellent support for 'legacy' browsers such as <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>7. That last point is especially important for the target user, who often uses an older browser.</p>
						<p class="text">Content is administrated from a custom <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, and instantly available through the API. The CMS includes deep analytics integration through <a href="http://www.mixpanel.com">MixPanel</a>, and a custom dashboard that updates live as transactions happen elsewhere. It's a command centre for the whole Livestock Event: anyone can get an overview of the entire business at a glance. There's an intelligent notification system that lets RABDF employees know when action needs to happen, a tile-builder for adding and editing content on the site, and deep search and model management features that have enabled RABDF to replace their existing <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> system.</p>
						<p class="text">What about maintainability? Most web code is pretty easy to understand, if you have the right background. If you don't, what then? There's nothing worse than being delivered an intractable mess of vermicelli code. Aside from commenting everything I write, I include a Developer Guide to extending and maintaining whatever I deliver. That way, you're free to go wherever suits you best.</p>

						<h2 class="text">Surprise and Delight</h2>
						<p class="text">Great <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> is about more than usability. Making a site that structures content in a clear, accessible and minimal way is only half the story: great sites are <i>pleasurable</i> â€“ <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stephenpa/creating-pleasurable-interfaces-getting-from-tasks-to-experiences">even <i>meaningful</i></a> â€“ to those who use them.</p>
						<p class="text">Sometimes pleasure and usability coincide. For example, I've used <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> animations to convey relationships between information. Here's an example: some 'tiles' can be flipped to reveal additional content. No page loads â€“ no drop-off â€“ but no skimping on info, either.</p>

						<h2 class="text">Biagio the Jeweller</h2>
						<p class="text">Biagio hand-sources every item he sells, and needed a website to match. He needed full eCommerce integration with his stock-checking and jewellery-making services, without the customer ever realising that he was outsourcing these to the experts. Every button, every interaction, needed to be on-brand.</p>

						<h2 class="text">Everything social</h2>
						<p class="lede text">Facebook pages, Twitter analytics, Pinterest dashboards, Newsletter segmentation tools Ã¢Â€Â“ everything Biagio needed to take his business into the world of social media, and watch it grow.</p>
						<p class="text">Social media presents a huge opportunity for retailers like Biagio, but needs fine-tuning to get right. Omnipresent social sharing options have kept his Facebook Page engagement well above his competition. Thanks to some responsive email templates, his newsletter Ã¢Â€Â“ which has always reached thousands Ã¢Â€Â“ now bears nearly eight times the industry average conversion rate. The result? More customers in store, more traffic online, and greater attendance at the regular special events Biagio holds. Which, of course, you can sign up for online.</p>

						<h2 class="text">Live <abbr title="Point of Sale">POS</abbr> integration</h2>
						<p class="lede text">In-store purchases are handled via the industry-standard Bransom retail system. The Bransom system keeps product prices, stock, and other properties in sync across stores, regions, and commerces.</p>
						<p class="text">In the fast-moving world of retail jewellery, Biagio needs to keep tabs on product stock at any given moment. If a diamond ring is sold in store, that has to be reflected instantaneously online. Tight integration was critical to Biagio's success as a retailer, so I partnered with Bransom to deliver a world-first Bransom-Lemonstand module.</p>

						<h2 class="text">Integrate everything.</h2>
						<p class="lede text">Biagio retails hand-selected fine jewellery from all over the world, but he doesn't stop there.</p>
						<p class="text">He offers a UK-first service: the ability to build your own jewellery. Using the Goldmark and Gemsone product catalogues Ã¢Â€Â“ each containing billions of possible product combinations Ã¢Â€Â“ customers at Biagio the Jeweller can build precisely the piece they need. I was tasked with building a system that allowed customers to do exactly the same thing online, without losing that 'in-store' brand feeling. Oh, and the prices across the Goldmark and Gemsone catalogues vary minute-to-minute, as they're linked to real-time mineral and metal cost indices.</p>
						<p class="text">Some creative thinking was needed: first up, I couldn't store this info in Biagio's database, but Lemonstand needed it to be. In collaboration with the Lemonstand CTO, we developed an entirely <abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML">AJAX</abbr>-based technique for fetching live pricing data as the user requested it, and binding that data to the product upon submission to the cart. The result? That in-store jewellery-building experience, without having to leave the office.</p>
